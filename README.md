## Introduction

This is a student project by Lisa M. Venezia that will help me learn how to write Jasmine unit tests.  

The application is a feed reader that allows the user to select from a menu of several different feed sources.

## How to Execute

To execute this feed reader, download the source and open the index.html file in your browser of choice.  The menu will appear when you click on the "hamburger" icon on the upper left of the page.

## Dependencies
This project was created based on sample code provided by Udacity (http://www.udacity.com).  Also, I got some help by following Matthew Cranford's walkthrough (https://matthewcranford.com/feed-reader-walkthrough-part-3-menu-test-suite/)
